Adds a Customizer control to select one or multiple posts (and eventually terms and users).

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Customizer control to select one or multiple posts (and eventually terms and users).

When the [Customize Posts](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts) plugin is active, buttons will appear after the Select2 control to be able to create new posts to add to the selection.

Includes a reusable JavaScript component available at `wp.customize.ObjectSelectorComponent` which can be used in widgets or other locations.

For an example integration with widgets, see the [Post Collection widget](https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets/pull/10).

For an example integration with the Customize Posts plugin, see pending usage as the [Post Parent control](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/189#issuecomment-241216247).
